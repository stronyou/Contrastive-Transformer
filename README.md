This project is developed based on Python 3.12 and is recommended to run on a Windows 64-bit operating system with a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-12900HX processor and 32 GB of memory. The development environment uses PyCharm, and the Python interpreter is set to an Anaconda virtual environment.

Before running the project, the following libraries need to be installed: `torch`, `numpy`, and `tqdm`. You can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.12
conda activate myenv
pip install torch numpy tqdm
```

The main libraries used in the code include: `torch`, `torch.nn`, `torch.optim`, `torch.nn.functional`, `torch.utils.data`, `numpy`, `math`, `random`, `copy`, and `tqdm`. After completing the environment configuration, you can run the project code in PyCharm, ensuring that the Python interpreter is set to `D:/Anaconda/envs/myenv/python.exe`.
